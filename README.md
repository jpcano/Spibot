# Spibot

Robot that is controlled over the internet. It uses the webiopi python framework to access the low level peripherals from the Raspberry Pi and to create the REST services.

## TODO

* Stream video and audio from a webcam connected to the RPi and send it to the browser. Research websockets and webRTC.
* Capture key events in the frontend to control the robot.
